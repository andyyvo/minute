# Minute

## About the App
**Minute** is a mobile application designed to build public speaking confidence in students and young adults who find themselves with a project/research presentation and *no time* in their schedule to practice. With **Minute**, it only takes a minute to target your filler words, tone, and other public speaking metrics.

## Inspiration
**Minute** was inspired by Andy's personal experience with public speaking from a young age. Like many, Andy was incredibly nervous and avoided public speaking. While attending a summer program, Andy was called out to get in front of over a hundred other students where he had to talk about a random topic without any filler words for as long as possible (up to a minute). This *one minute word challenge* became an intense competition among Andy and his peers, evolved into a key resource for improving his public speaking abilities, and now serves as the drive behind this solution.
